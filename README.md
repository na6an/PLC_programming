# PLC_programming

## Motivation
PLC is the core of modern industrial control.  
It's not just used in manufacturing lines but also in power plants as part of SCADA systems or even in industrial robots.  
There is a reason some of top robotics companies such as ABB, Mitsubishi, Omron are PLC manufacturers, too.  

## Advantage/Disadvantage of PLC
PLC has some advantages and disadvantages comparing to Arduino, a famous DIY controller, or even using a PC as a controller.  
Advantages:  
1. Industrial grade (meaning durable, higher endurance against dust, temperature and continuous use, longevity, etc)  
2. Milli-second level response (some PLC supports micro-second level control)  
3. Built-in debug/diagnosis  

Disadvantage:  
1. Expensive - cheaper ones cost about $$$ (without software license), usually a few thousands to tens of thousands.  
2. Entry-barrier - requires electrical knowledge  
3. Limited data processing capacity - may not be suitable to handle data for DL/ML  
4. Lack of version control
